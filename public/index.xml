      <description>This blog My personal hero, Richard Feynman, knew that knowing the name of something is different from knowing that thing. This blog is the documentation of my personal struggle in learning new programming languages and tools so that I, and perhaps you, will understand it and explain it to a 6-year-old with ease.
Who am I I was born and raised in China but have the privilege of choosing where in the world I want to live and what kind of values I want to identify with.</description>

      <description>This is a blog post placeholder until I have real content.
For now, let me say to you in Python:
print(&amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34;) In Ruby:
puts &amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34; In Javascript:
console.log(&amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34;) In Go:
package main import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; func main() { fmt.Println(&amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34;) } And in Clojure:
(println &amp;#34;Hello World&amp;#34;) </description>
