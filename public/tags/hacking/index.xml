      <description>This is a long, detailed, and brutally honest post in which I recount the failures that challenged me and the right choices I made that I am grateful for. It is written in self-reflection as well as self-meditation for a small circle of friends and acquaintances. Should you, a dear stranger, find any inspiration or consolation in my writing, I would feel a great sense of joy and achievement.
 I am writing this not for the eyes of the many, but for yours alone: for each of us is audience enough for the other.</description>
