## This blog
My personal hero, Richard Feynman, knew that knowing the name of
something is different from knowing that thing. This blog is the
documentation of my personal struggle in learning new programming
languages and tools so that I, and perhaps you, will understand it and
explain it to a 6-year-old with ease.

## Who am I
I was born and raised in China but have the privilege of choosing where
in the world I want to live and what kind of values I want to
identify with.

I speak fluent English and Mandarin Chinese. My German is currently at
level C1 and I work on improving my spoken German further.

## Formal education
My formal education constituted a bachelor's degree in history from
Texas A&M University and a master's degree in international business from Stockholm School of Economics.

## Programming story
When I was 16, I tried Turbo Pascal in a crash course session at my high
school. I did not know that most other students in the session had
already learned programming one way or another, so I felt stupid and was
scared out of ever touching a DOS again.

About 10 years later, over a coffee in a mountaineous town in
Switzerland, a kind and friendly value investor recommended me
to learn Python for machine learning. Though reluctant, I bit my teeth
and gave it a try.

The rest is history.

## Contact
If you are in Berlin and share similar interests in programming,
history, politics, leadership, or classical music, feel free to [reach
out to me][1]; I will try and respond within a few days.
