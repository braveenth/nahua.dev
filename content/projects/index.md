I am currently in learning mode.

## Languages I speak
Some of my current focuses include:

- Python (*my first language*) and Django
- Ruby and Ruby on Rails
- Javascript and React JS
- MacVim

Just for fun and hobby:
- Golang and Hugo
- Clojure (purely for fun)

## Ambition on projects
I intend to be able to:

- Dig deeper into Python and Ruby
- Contribute to an open source project in either languages
- Complete CS50W course

## Deep Learning
Previously, I have completed Udacity's Nanodegree Foundation in Deep
Learning. You might have seen my posts on deep learning before on
Medium.
