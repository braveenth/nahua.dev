## Professional Work

Currently I work professionally as a software engineer for [Twenty Billion Neurons](https://20bn.com/). My day-to-day role is using Python to implement the "logical functionality" of the brain of a deep-learning-powered [virtual fitness trainer Ally](https://fitnessallyapp.com/). Download the app in App Store, it's amazing!

## Open Source Projects

I am a firm believer in open source software. As of now, I devote my spare time to contribute to [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/), the privacy-preserving AI project that aims to unlock the power of deep learning and data while respecting the privacy for each individual.

My roles include:

- Contributor to [PyGrid](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid)
- Contributor to [Syft.JS](https://github.com/OpenMined/syft.js)
- Contributor to [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft)
- Editor of OpenMined's amazing Writing Team ([read our blogs](https://blog.openmined.org/))
- Member of OpenMined's Bootcamp Tech Team
